Sponza Model originally modeled by Marko Dabrovic

This particular version was downloaded from:

You can use any OBJ file you want but take note that the OBJ file loader
in the sample code is only tested on this particular model so you *might*
have to modify/fix some code if you want other OBJ files to load.
